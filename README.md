The Super Hero Match App allows the user to answer the ultimate question:

“If I could be a super hero, which super hero (or super villain) would I be?”

This project matches the user to a super hero/villain, based on the user’s personality and image. After answering a series of personality questions and uploading an image, the user will be provided their matching superhero or villain.

We envision this app being used by super-hero and super-villain fans of all ages.  Or even people who want a fun way of taking a personality quiz.

Now, when you’re ever asked the question of which super hero is most like you, you can point them to our app!
